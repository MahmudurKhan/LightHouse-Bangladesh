                            <p><span class="firstcharacter">L</span>earning and development as many refer to it now -- is one of the most important aspects of our lives and our work. Many people view "training" as an activity that produces the result or outcome of "learning" -- and learning is typically viewed as new knowledge, skills and competencies or abilities. In our culture, we highly value learning. Yet, despite our having attended many years of schooling, many of us have no idea how to carefully design an approach to training and development.</p>

                            <p>It remains a common belief that the biggest benefit of learning is to get a diploma or a credential, but as one gets older and wiser, he realizes that there are many more benefits to learning than just that. Knowing the core of learning will help motivate one’s design to the training plans and programs, and motivate others to participate as well.</p>

                            <p>There are different, major forms of learning and development, and we are most familiar with formal forms of learning and development that include the strong attention to the systematic structure and evaluation of learning and development, especially as used in schooling. We are also expanding the concept of learning beyond that of just individuals, but introducing the idea that groups and organizations can learn too. Lastly, a training program is an intentionally designed, highly integrated set of activities that are aligned to accomplish a certain criteria of results among learners.</p>

A typical headhunt would involve commissioning an executive search firm to help define and advise on the role to be recruited, pull together a target list of companies (anything from 20 - 50, usually competitors) to headhunt into, identifying people in posts through research, seeking recommendations and tracking high performance individuals. The search organization will then contact these individuals.</p>

They use their business skills to provide objective advice and expertise and help an organization to develop any specialist skills that it may be lacking.</p>

                            <p><span class="firstcharacter">I</span>ndividual and Team Coaching are vastly different, and coaching sometimes becomes an integral part of a larger project, but it is also an intervention in itself. We coach individuals and teams on different types of learning questions, ranging from the more practical levels to the identity levels.</p>

                            <p>Individual Coaching asks questions regarding reflection on performance, getting in touch with ones thoughts, personal questions on motivation and career developments, whereas team coaching deals with issues such as creating a shared purpose, making use of all strengths, dealing with diversity, enhancing collaboration, creating open communication and increasing the external focus of a group.</p>

                            <p>Lighthouse offers individual and group coaching within organizations. Both kinds of coaching may be combined to resolve personal and group issues. Individual coaching addresses interpersonal relationships, and/or personal growth, and leadership abilities. Group coaching also addresses these issues but within the context of group dynamics. Our different individual and team oriented multi-party instruments help these developmental efforts.</p>
